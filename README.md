# Pok3r rules for Karabiner

Full readme is coming.

## Installation

- Copy pok3r.json file to your `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex-modifications` folder.
- Open karabiner and add rules on complex modifications tab

Choose one of this rules for defining modifiers:

- Pok3r: Right option to fn
- Pok3r: Caps to Fn
- Pok3r: Space to Fn or self

## Known issues

- When using right_option as fn, left_option+arrows (i/j/k/l) don't work. Happens only on mac keyboard. On my Genius keyboard works fine.
